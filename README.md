  This repo contains every personal project I've made, a part of them are more software-oriented while the majority are related to embedded firmware development / hardware design.

  The most interesting and complex projects I have made are the following: 
    - Proiect-SMCA_PA - "Statie de masurarea a calitatii aerului si a parametrilor ambientali", where i combined PCB design, circuit design, firmware programming, wiring, power conversion and renewable energy(solar). This project is well documented!

 There are no days to pass without learning new stuff by myself, this helps me aquire new information that I am going to use it in designing and creating useful devices/equipments which improve lifestyle or solve existent problems.
