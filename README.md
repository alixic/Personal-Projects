  This repo contains every personal project I've made, a part of them are more software-oriented while the majority are related to embedded firmware development / hardware design.

  The most interesting and complex projects I have made are the following: 
  
    - Proiect-SMCA_PA - "Statie de masurarea a calitatii aerului si a parametrilor ambientali", where i combined PCB design, circuit design, firmware programming, wiring, power conversion and renewable energy(solar). This project is well documented!
