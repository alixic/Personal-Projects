  This repo contains every personal project I've made, a part of them are more software-oriented while the majority are related to embedded firmware development / hardware design.

  
  The most interesting and complex projects I have made are the following: (HW->Hardware oriented, SW->Software oriented)
  
    - HW+SW -> Proiect-SMCA_PA - "Statie de masurarea a calitatii aerului si a parametrilor ambientali", where i combined PCB design, circuit design, firmware programming, wiring, power conversion and renewable energy(solar). This project is well documented! 
    - HW+SW -> Robot-electronic-monitozirare-si-control - my own autonomous robot, remote controlled, built using modules. I started my journey in embedded systems development with this project.
    - HW-> Proiect-desgin-amplificator-audio-de-putere - PCB & circuit design for the power amplifier
    - 


 There are no days to pass without learning new stuff by myself which helps me to aquire new information that I am going to use in designing and creating useful devices/equipments which improve lifestyle or solve existent problems.
